# CIFAR-100 Classification Experiment with CNN and MLP

This project is a machine learning experiment focused on image classification using the CIFAR-100 dataset. It compares the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

---

## Objective

To explore and evaluate different neural network architectures (CNN vs MLP) in classifying 100 different categories from the CIFAR-100 dataset. The project investigates how each architecture performs with and without data augmentation.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab (for training and visualization)
